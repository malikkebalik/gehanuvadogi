A spokesperson for the show responded to the allegations, stating, "The storylines of American Gods have continually shifted and evolved to reflect the complex mythology of the source material.

I do not decide how people feel or react to that. My tweet hit a nerve. That's good. The fact that is has taken precedent over the serious issues that face us is not good. Any anger directed at me and my right to free speech is an absolute waste of time. I am not a statesman. My comments reflect no political affiliation. It's just me being me, in a world that will never comfortably mix political correctness with artistic expression. For that, I offer no apologies, excuses or wisdom."</p><h2 id=award-nominations><strong>Award Nominations</strong></h2><p>In 2017, Jones received a Black Reel Award nomination for Outstanding Supporting Actor, TV Movie or Limited Series for "Madiba."
