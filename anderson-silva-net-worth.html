with his teammate and friend, Tom Egan, being the first.</p><p>In April 2013, McGregor made his UFC Featherweight debut against Marcus Brimage, winning by technical knockout in the 1st round, and receiving his first <strong>“Knockout of the Night”</strong> bonus.</p><p>During the post-fight speech, McGregor took the microphone and addressed <a href=# data-lasso-id=130044 data-wpel-link=internal>Dana White</a> with the now-famous quote: “Dana, 60 G’s baby!”</p><p>After winning his debut, he went on to receive victories against his next four opponents: <a href=# data-lasso-id=130045 data-wpel-link=internal>Max Holloway</a>, Diego Brandao, Dustin Poirier, and Dennis Silver.</p><h4><strong>UFC Featherweight Championship</strong></h4><p>In 2015, the fight for the <strong>UFC Featherweight Championship</strong> belt between Conor McGregor and <a href=# data-lasso-id=130046 data-wpel-link=internal>Jose Aldo</a> was announced.</p><p>The pair went on a 12-day world tour doing interviews leading up to the event, with the UFC stating that this was the most heavily promoted fight thus far in the organization’s 22-year history.</p><p>Aldo would end up pulling out of the fight due to a rib injury, which led to Conor McGregor fighting, and defeating, Chad Mendes for the UFC Interim Featherweight Champion belt.</p><p>On the 10th of August, 2015, the fight for the Featherweight Championship between Aldo and McGregor was announced once again.</p><p>In December 2015, McGregor would knock out Jose Aldo in just 13 seconds (the fastest-ever knockout for a title bout), earning himself the UFC Featherweight Championship belt.</p><p>The Notorious suffered his very first UFC loss in 2016 to <a href=# data-lasso-id=130047 data-wpel-link=internal>Nate Diaz</a>, in a fight that took place in the Welterweight division. After losing due to submission in the first fight, a rematch took place just 5 months later, where McGregor would avenge his loss via a majority decision.</p><h4>UFC Lightweight Championship</h4><p>In November 2016, McGregor beat Eddie Alvarez to win the UFC Lightweight Championship belt, marking the first time a fighter had simultaneously held belts in two divisions.</p><p>It was after this moment, that McGregor’s career would start to take a downturn.</p><p>Conor took time away from the sport for the birth of his first child, and he was stripped of his Featherweight Championship belt due to his inactivity within the division.</p><p>In 2018, McGregor would also be stripped of the Lightweight Championship belt, once again due to inactivity.</p><p>His career in the UFC has since been relatively sporadic, with losses to <a href=# data-lasso-id=130048 data-wpel-link=internal>Khabib Nurmagomedov</a> and Dustin Poirier, and a single win over the cowboy Donald Cerrone.</p><p>McGregor is currently anticipated to return to the UFC sometime in 2023 to face off against the veteran <a href=# data-lasso-id=130049 data-wpel-link=internal>Michael Chandler</a>.</p><h3>Professional Boxing Debut</h3><p>In 2017, McGregor announce his professional boxing debut against the undefeated, Floyd ‘Money’ Mayweather Jr.</p><p>The fight took place on the 26th of August, 2017 at the T-Mobile Arena in Paradise, Nevada.</p><p>It was stated that Conor would receive a guaranteed <strong>$30 million</strong> for the fight, Whilst Mayweather would receive $100 million.</p><p>McGregor lost by TKO in round 10, however, the event was such a success that McGregor ended up earning an estimated $130 million from the fight.</p><h3>Proper No. Twelve</h3><p>In September 2018, Conor McGregor launched his own whiskey brand, ‘Proper No. Twelve Irish Whiskey’, named after the childhood neighborhood he grew up in.</p><p>In 2021, a deal was struck for McGregor and his business partners to sell their 51% majority stake in the company to Proximo Spirits, who already owned the other 49% of the company.</p><p>The deal was <strong>estimated to be worth $600 million</strong>, making McGregor even richer overnight.</p><p>Finalization of the deal means that Conor McGregor no longer owns a stake in the Proper No. Twelve Irish Whiskey brand.</p><h3>Endorsements</h3><p>Conor McGregor has partnered with and been endorsed by many brands throughout the years.&nbsp;</p><p>Here are several that we can mention:</p><ul><li>Monster Energy</li><li>Reebok</li><li>Beats Electronics</li><li>Burger King</li><li>Anheuser-Busch InBev</li><li>Budweiser</li></ul><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=conor-mcgregors-net-worth></span>Conor McGregor’s Net Worth<span

payday, plus a $60,000 bonus.</p><p>However, his earnings per fight would quickly increase as his stardom grew, and within just a couple of years, he was earning millions.</p><h3>UFC Fight Earnings&nbsp;</h3><p>In 2015, Mcgregor fought three times, with two of those fights being multi-million dollar paydays.</p><p>The fight against Chad Mendes in July earned McGregor $3.3 million, and the record-breaking 13-second fight against Jose Aldo earned the Irishman a juicy $4.5 million.</p><p>In 2016, his fights against Nate Diaz and Chad Mendes would earn him another combined $12.4 million.</p><p>By 2017, McGregor’s net worth was estimated to be $35 million.</p><h3>Professional Boxing Debut</h3><p>McGregor’s biggest payday by far came in August 2017 when he faced Floyd Mayweather Jr in his professional boxing debut.</p><p>It was estimated that Conor earned more than $100 million for the fight.</p><h3>Proper Twelve Sale</h3><p>It’s unclear as to how much McGregor made from the sale of Proper Twelve in 2021.&nbsp;</p><p>McGregor and his business partners sold their remaining 51% stake in the business for $600 million.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section
