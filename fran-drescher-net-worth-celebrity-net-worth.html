He agreed to set up a meeting when the parties were back in Los Angeles, but Drescher didn't actually have an idea for a show yet. Luckily, the premise of the show came to her before she returned to L.A. The show stars Drescher as the title character whose name is also Fran. The show follows Fran, a Jewish fashionista who becomes a nanny for a wealthy British family living in New York City.</p><p>Much of the show draws from Drescher's time growing up in Queens and features characters based on people in her life. It premiered on CBS in November of 1993, but it struggled in its first season and would have been canceled but for Sagansky's support. Drescher also went on a lengthy promotional campaign, flying around the country and giving interviews on local CBS-affiliated news stations. Their work paid off in its third season when it began to see consistently high ratings and increased viewership. For her acting on the show, she received two Golden Globe nominations, two Primetime Emmy Award nominations, and an American Comedy Award nomination. The series ran for six seasons, and it concluded in June of 1999.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-167511 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/GettyImages-171694292.jpg alt="Fran Drescher" width=449 height=594 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p id=caption-attachment-167511 class=wp-caption-text>Mark Sullivan / Getty Images</p><h2 id=post-2000s-career><strong>Post 2000s Career</strong></h2><p>After "The Nanny" ended, Drescher took sporadic guest star roles on television shows until creating and producing her next sitcom idea. "Living with Fran" premiered in June of 2005 on the WB Television Network, which no longer exists. Although the series was considered to be successful, it only lasted two season and left the air in March of 2006. In 2010, she briefly had her own talk show called "The Fran Drescher Tawk Show," but it failed to receive high enough ratings during its test run. She and her ex-husband Jacobson reunited to create another sitcom, which was appropriately called "Happily Divorced." The series premiered in June of 2011 on TV Land and ended in February of 2013 after two seasons.</p><h2 id=personal-life><strong>Personal Life</strong></h2><p>Drescher married her first husband, Peter Marc Jacsobson, in 1978 at age twenty-one. The couple divorced in 1999, but they maintained a working relationship. He came out as gay after their divorce, and the two have remained close. In 1985, Drescher, her friend, and Jacobson were home when two armed robbers broke in. Jacobson was tied up and beaten, and Drescher and her friend were raped at gunpoint. The perpetrators were found and charged. In 2000, she was diagnosed with uterine cancer and wrote about her experience in a book titled "Cancer Smancer." She founded the nonprofit organization the Cancer Smancer Movement in 2007 and helps promote early cancer detection in women.</p><p>In September of 2008, she was appointed as the Public Diplomacy Envoy for Women's Health Issues by the Bush administration. In her capacity as a diplomat, she travelled throughout the world advocating for higher quality healthcare for women and spent much of her time in Central and Eastern Europe. She is a democrat who is sympathetic to the Green Party and supported Hilary Clinton in the 2008 democratic primary and <a href=# title="Barack Obama Net Worth">Barack Obama</a>'s 2012 reelection.</p><h2 id=real-estate><strong>Real Estate</strong></h2><p>In 1997, Fran paid $1.225 million for a beachfront home in Malibu.
