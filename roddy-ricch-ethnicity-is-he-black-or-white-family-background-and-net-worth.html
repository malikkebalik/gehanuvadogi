Learn about his ethnic background by reading on.</strong></p><p style=color:#252525>Rodrick Wayne Moore Jr., known professionally as Roddy Ricch, is an American rapper, singer, and songwriter. With his track “Die Young,” which peaked at number 98 on the Billboard Hot 100, he gained notoriety in 2018.</p><p style=color:#252525>He appeared on Nipsey Hussle’s hit “Racks in the Middle” and Mustard’s Grammy-nominated single “Ballin'” and received considerable praise for his first two mixtapes.</p><p style=color:#252525>His first chart-topping record, “Please Forgive Me for Being Antisocial,” off his 2019 debut album, arrived at the top of the Billboard 200.</p><p style=color:#252525>The Hot 100’s number-one single “The Box” and the top-ten track “High Fashion” were both born from it.

Wikipedia Bio And Net Worth</a></p><h2 style=color:#252525>Roddy Ricch Ethnicity: Is He Black or White?</h2><p style=color:#252525>The parents of rapper Ricch are of African American descent and are from Atlanta, Georgia, so that makes him of African descent.</p><p style=color:#252525>The veteran rapper’s skin tone reflects his family’s origin and history, which is thought to have African roots.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthypeeps.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Roddy-Ricch-2.jpg><p style=color:#252525>However, his ancestral heritage is not known at the moment. Furthermore, he is of American nationality.</p><h2 style=color:#252525>Roddy Ricch&nbsp;Family Background</h2><p style=color:#252525>Moore Jr. was born in a Christian household on October 22, 1998, in Compton, California. He was raised in a middle-class family and had access to all the necessities he required as a young boy because of his parents’ financial assistance.</p><p style=color:#252525>At the age of eight, he started rapping; at twelve, he performed for superstar and fellow Compton local Kendrick Lamar.</p><p style=color:#252525>The singer attended Compton High School for his schooling. He experienced a violent awakening, which put him in several risky circumstances.</p><p style=color:#252525>He used to be a member of the Compton gang known as the Park Village Compton Crips. His torso has two “C” tattoos to signify his previous gang affiliation.</p><p style=color:#252525>At the young age of 15, his parents took action by ejecting him from their home due to the intensity of his involvement in street life.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthypeeps.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Roddy-Ricch-11.jpg><p style=color:#252525>Rodrick began actively composing beats at the age of 16. He also served a brief time in county jail around the same time as the release of Feed the Streets II, his second commercial mixtape.</p><p style=color:#252525>He grew up listening to artists like Young Thug, Future, Meek Mill, and Lil Wayne and took them as inspiration.</p><p style=color:#252525><span style=font-family:var(--global-body-font-family);color:#252525>Perhaps because of the trauma from his past, Wayne rarely talks about his parents. Before that, he and his family spent most of his formative years moving from place to place.</span></p><p style=color:#252525><span style=font-family:var(--global-body-font-family);color:#252525>His parents’ travels when he was a little child eventually inspired his music style decades later.</span></p><h2 style=color:#252525>Roddy Ricch’s Net Worth: Explored</h2><p style=color:#252525>The rapper has been in the music industry since he was a teenager, and he has over two dozen official tracks to his credit. As a result, we may fairly presume he has amassed a significant fortune for himself.</p><p style=color:#252525>Since his commercial debut, Rick has released songs such as “Be 4 Tha Fame,” “Die Young,” “Dreamchasers,” and many more.</p><p style=color:#252525>He appeared on Meek Mill’s “Letter to Nipsey,” NLE Choppa’s “Walk Em Down,” DaBaby’s “Rockstar,” and Pop Smoke’s posthumous single “The Woo.”</p><p style=color:#252525>The American rapper became the first musician since Ed Sheeran in 2017 to have two number-one singles in the same year.
