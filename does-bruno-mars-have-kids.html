Mars turned to songwriting and signed a music publishing deal with Westside Independent. There he was mentored by Steve Lindsey. Mars was a successful songwriter and producer before he ever found success as a solo artist working with artists such as Adam Levine and Brandy.</p><h3 id=h-bruno-mars-gets-his-big-break data-injectable=false>Bruno Mars gets his big break</h3><p data-characters=461 data-current-count=461 data-injectable=true>Mars’ big break for his solo career came when he collaborated with rapper B.o.B on the song Nothin’ on You in 2009 and with Travie McCoy on the song Billionaire in 2010. These songs were highly successful and exposed Mars to a whole new fan base. Off of the momentum of these successes, he released his own EP It’s Better If You Don’t Understand in May 2010. In July 2010, Mars followed this up with his first album Doo-Wops & Hooligans.</p><h2 id=h-bruno-mars-accomplishments data-injectable=false>Bruno Mars’ accomplishments</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=349 data-current-count=649 data-injectable=true>The rest, they say, is history.
