His father, Charles, died when Ron was a child, so White and his sister, Shea, were raised by their mother, Barbara Joan Craig. Ron attended Deer Park High School, and at age 17, he enlisted in the United States Navy and served on the USS Conserver during the "tail end of the Vietnam War." During his time in the Navy, Ron earned the nickname "Tater Salad," after he yelled to a soldier that was supposed to relieve him during a picnic, "Get up here and relieve me before somebody eats all that Tater Salad!" After leaving the Navy, White briefly owned a pottery factory in Mexico. Ron had been dreaming of a comedy career since a young age, and so he decided to pursue comedy when he returned to the U.S.</p><h2 id=career><strong>Career</strong></h2><p>White first performed stand-up comedy in 1986 and opened for Jeff Foxworthy and <a href=# title="Sam Kinison Net Worth">Sam Kinison</a> before becoming a headliner.

His next three albums, 2006's "You Can't Fix Stupid," 2009's "Behavioral Problems," and 2013's "A Little Unprofessional," topped the Comedy Albums chart, and "You Can't Fix Stupid" reached #2 on the Top Country Albums chart. &nbsp;White guest-starred on "12 Miles of Bad Road" (2007), "Reno 911!"

My decision to run for President of the United States of America came from a lack of choices. I've watched the debates and I thought to myself: Is this what we have to choose from? For 30 years I have traveled this country back and forth, up and down. I love you people and you have told me what you think is wrong and what you want to see change. So if you want me to do this, I will." White's slogan for his presidential run was "Vote Smart! Because You Can't Fix Stupid."

In August 2019, a judge ruled that White and Rey were in a common-law marriage according to Texas law. In April 2020, Ron asked a judge to end his monthly $25,000 payments to Margo because he wasn't able to make any income during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>White is a supporter of the Red Cross and the Armed Forces Foundation, and in 2009, he launched "Ron White's Comedy Salute to the Troops." The profits from the annual charity show's ticket sales and DVD sales benefit the Armed Forces Foundation, and comedians such as <a href=# title="Brian Regan Net Worth">Brian Regan</a>, <a href=# title="Lewis Black Net Worth">Lewis Black</a>, <a href=# title="Kathleen Madigan Net Worth">Kathleen Madigan</a>, and Dave Attell have performed.</p><p>White stopped drinking alcohol in early 2021 but was reportedly seen drinking a beer in September 2023 during a show.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-324350 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Ron-White.jpg alt="Ron White" width=900 height=677 sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-324350 class=wp-caption-text>(Photo by Rick Diamond/Getty Images)</p><h2 id=awards-nominations><strong>Awards and Nominations</strong></h2><p>White has earned three Grammy nominations for Best Comedy Album, for "Blue Collar Comedy Tour: One for the Road" (shared with Bill Engvall, Jeff Foxworthy and Larry the Cable Guy) and "You Can't Fix Stupid" in 2007 and "A Little Unprofessional" in 2014.
