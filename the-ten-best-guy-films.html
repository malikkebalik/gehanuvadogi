Jason Statham, Jet Li, Steve Austin, Dolph Lundgren, Bruce Willis and more will make appearances here and <strong>The Expendables </strong>is sure to be the ‘guy’ movie of the summer.</p><p data-characters=107 data-current-count=107 data-injectable=false>With the film only a few days away from being released, we count down the ten best ‘guy’ films.</p><p data-characters=348 data-current-count=455 data-injectable=true>*I just want to clarify, that when I say ‘guy’ film, I don’t mean that these films aren’t for girls or girls shouldn’t watch them or girls can’t handle them, I’m just saying that due to the subject matter and content, for the most part, these films will find bigger audiences with males than with females.</p><p data-characters=1 data-current-count=1 data-injectable=false><span id=more-2711></span></p><p style=text-align:center data-characters=0 data-current-count=1 data-injectable=false><a href=#><img decoding=async title=FCJG300-0090 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/FCJG300-0090.jpg alt width=580 height=290 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p data-characters=6 data-current-count=7 data-injectable=false><strong>1) 300</strong></p><p data-characters=343 data-current-count=350 data-injectable=false>Based on the graphic novel of the same name, <strong>300 </strong>stars <strong>Gerard Butler</strong> and is directed by <strong>Zack Snyder</strong>. Blood, gore and murder have never looked so pretty. The film is an epic exercise in slaughter and killing. It tells the story of an army of Spartans, 300 strong, who go up against Xerxes and the Persian army which numbers in the millions.</p><p data-characters=363 data-current-count=713 data-injectable=true>Visually arresting is an understatement to describe this film. Filmed almost entirely on a green screen, the battles play out perfectly. Slow motion, CG shenanigans, extraordinary feats and more fill the screen. While it’s certainly not the best-written narrative with the best-developed characters, <strong>300 </strong>is an awesome battle epic that never stops having fun.</p><p data-characters=218 data-current-count=218 data-injectable=false>The violence is over the top but it’s very stylized and it makes the film that much more enthralling. All the characters are hardened warriors, prepared to fight to the death and it makes for quite an epic movie.</p><p data-characters=109 data-current-count=327 data-injectable=false>While the blood and violence may be a bit too much for some, if you can handle it,&nbsp;<strong>300 </strong><span style=font-style:normal>is a blast to watch.</span></p><p style=text-align:center data-characters=0 data-current-count=327 data-injectable=false><a href=#><img decoding=async title=Trainspotting src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/Trainspotting.jpg alt width=590 height=290 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p data-characters=17 data-current-count=344 data-injectable=false><strong>#2) Trainspotting</strong></p><p data-characters=218 data-current-count=562 data-injectable=true>The film’s tagline says it all. Choose life. Choose a job. Choose a starter home. Choose dental insurance, leisure wear and matching luggage. Choose your future. But why would anyone want to do a thing like that?</p><p data-characters=185 data-current-count=185 data-injectable=false>As Renton says in the film “I chose not to choose life.

Who needs reasons when you’ve got heroin?”</p><p data-characters=318 data-current-count=503 data-injectable=true><strong>Trainspotting<span style=font-weight:400> is one of my favorite films and it is by far Danny Boyle’s best movie. It revolves around a group of heroin addicts in the late 1980’s. Starring Ewan McGregor in one of his first and still one of his best roles, this film is considered by many to be one of the greatest of the 20th&nbsp;century.</span></strong></p><p data-characters=200 data-current-count=200 data-injectable=false><strong><span style=font-weight:400>The gritty feel of the film, the inspired direction and a near flawless script make </span>Trainspotting<span style=font-weight:400> a must watch movie.

The film won a handful of Academy Awards and is considered to be one of the best movies to come out in the past 10-20 years.</p><p data-characters=290 data-current-count=290 data-injectable=false>Violence and fighting are found in great abundance here but what else were you expecting? This is a guy film in the truest sense.&nbsp;Featuring several fantastic fights in the Colosseum, one of which has Crowe facing off against a tiger, this movie is most definitely one that you need to see.</p><p data-characters=379 data-current-count=669 data-injectable=true><span style=font-weight:400>Critics applauded Crowe’s flawless performance and they were impressed with the sheer entertainment value of it all. It’s an inspiring story and one that will never grow old. It’s</span> another one of my favorite films and one that I can watch over and over again and not tire of it.

It was one of the defining action films of the 1980’s and to this day it is still considered a classic. While the second, third and fourth films never reached the level that the original one did, they are all still great thrill rides and are definitely worth seeing.</p><p data-characters=309 data-current-count=309 data-injectable=false>Bruce Willis stars as John McClane, a character who has appeared on numerous lists regarding top movie heroes/characters. In each film McClane, a NYPD cop, finds himself in a different predicament. No matter what the situation is, you can count on the Die Hard films to offer a roller coaster ride of a movie.</p><p data-characters=447 data-current-count=756 data-injectable=true>The plots are all fairly generic but the action and Bruce Willis’ performance make the films. The first film worked so well because McClane never wanted to be a hero. He’s forced into the role and the odds are stacked heavily against him. The film came complete with a smart script and non stop suspense. Even though the sequels weren’t as good, they are still above average action films and are films that demand your attention.</p><p style=text-align:center data-characters=0 data-current-count=0 data-injectable=false><a href=#><img decoding=async title=rambo01 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/rambo01.jpg alt width=585 height=213 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p data-characters=23 data-current-count=23 data-injectable=false><strong>#9) Rambo (All of them)</strong></p><p data-characters=299 data-current-count=322 data-injectable=false>I wanted to go with <strong>Rocky<span style=font-weight:400> but my gut told me to go with </span>Rambo<span style=font-weight:400>. While both are guy movies in the purest sense, I think <strong>Rambo</strong> is a bit more manlier.

Relentless in his goal, Rambo is a killing machine and Stallone plays the part perfectly. Stallone created one of the most iconic action heroes of all time and to this day, very few action film characters rival Rambo.

He literally leaves a path of destruction behind him. Aside from the first Rambo film, the body counts are always high and there’s more than enough blood and violence.
