He had an older brother named Roddy who passed away in 2019. Mullin caught the basketball bug early in life, and regularly traveled to the Bronx and Harlem to play against some of the best basketball players in the city. His local profile grew when he played CYO basketball at St. Thomas Aquinas Parish; he also won a national free throw youth contest in 1974. As a teen, Mullin attended Power Memorial Academy before transferring to Xaverian High School as a junior. He led the latter school to a New York Class A state championship in 1981.</p><h2 id=collegiate-career><strong>Collegiate Career</strong></h2><p>For college, Mullin was recruited by Hall of Fame coach Lou Carnesecca to play basketball at St. John's University in Queens.

During his first three seasons with the team, he served primarily as a spot-up shooting guard in the backcourt. The best of those was his second season, when the Warriors reached the Western Conference semifinals. In his third season, Mullin admitted to new team coach <a href=# title="Don Nelson Net Worth">Don Nelson</a> that he was an alcoholic; after missing a number of practices, he was suspended, and subsequently entered a rehab program. Mullin returned in 1988 to kick off a career resurgence. For five consecutive seasons through 1993, he scored an average of 25 points or more, helping the Warriors make it to five consecutive playoffs. In the playoffs, he formed a trio known as "Run TMC" with <a href=# title="Mitch Richmond Net Worth">Mitch Richmond</a> and <a href=# title="Tim Hardaway Net Worth">Tim Hardaway</a>. Mullin's performance began declining in 1993 as his physical condition worsened and he started missing numerous games. Seen as injury-prone, he was given a less central role on the team, which instead grew increasingly centered on <a href=# title="Latrell Sprewell Net Worth">Latrell Sprewell</a>.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-172066 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Chris-Mullin1.jpg alt="Chris Mullin net worth" width=594 height=462 sizes="(max-width: 594px) 100vw, 594px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-172066 class=wp-caption-text>Jim Rogash/Getty Images</p><h2 id=indiana-pacers><strong>Indiana Pacers</strong></h2><p>Following the 1996-97 season, Mullin was traded to the Indiana Pacers. In his first season with the team, he started all 82 games and averaged 11.3 points per game. Mullin helped lead the Pacers to the Eastern Conference Finals, where they fell to the Chicago Bulls in seven games. In his second season in Indiana, he was moved more toward the background as <a href=# title="Jalen Rose Net Worth">Jalen Rose</a> was given more time at small forward. While mostly a bench player in 2000, Mullin appeared in three games of the NBA Finals, where the Pacers lost to the Los Angeles Lakers in six games.</p><h2 id=return-golden-state-warriors><strong>Return to the Golden State Warriors</strong></h2><p>Mullin returned to his original team, the Warriors, for the 2000-01 season.

Mullin left the team in 2009, and four years later became an advisor for the Sacramento Kings. In 2015, he took over the vacant head coaching position at his alma mater St. John's University. Mullin led the school to a 21-13 record and an NCAA tournament appearance in the 2018-19 season. Following that season, he resigned as head coach.</p><h2 id=broadcasting-career><strong>Broadcasting Career</strong></h2><p>In 2010, Mullin joined ESPN as an NBA studio analyst.
