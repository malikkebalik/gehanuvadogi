She also spoke about the "Saved by the Bell" reboot, stating, "'I have to admit I did feel a bit slighted and hurt when I was not invited to be part of the 'Saved by the Bell' reunion as well as other cast members events, yet of course, I also realized that having this puzzling disorder may have played a major part in that factual decision." Voorhies later said that her appearance on "The Dr. Oz Show" contributed to the "Saved by the Bell" producers "rethinking [her] value to the production" and that getting to play Lisa Turtle again helped with her Schizoaffective Thought Disorder.</p><h2 id=awards-nominations><strong>Awards and Nominations</strong></h2><p>Lark has been nominated for six Young Artist Awards.
