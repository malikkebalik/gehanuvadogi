He played college football for Texas Christian University, and then played for the San Diego Chargers for most of his professional career. Overall, Tomlinson was invited to five Pro Bowls, became an All-Pro six times, and was named the NFL MVP for the 2006 season.</p><h2 id=early-life-career-beginnings><strong>Early Life and Career Beginnings</strong></h2><p>LaDainian Tomlinson was born in 1979 in Rosebud, Texas to Loreane and Oliver, the latter of whom left the family when Tomlinson was seven. At the age of nine, he joined the Pop Warner Little Scholars football program, with which he scored his first touchdown. As a teen, Tomlinson went to University High School in Waco, Texas, where he played football, baseball, and basketball, and also ran track. During his senior year as an offensive player, he racked up 2,554 yards and 39 touchdowns.</p><h2 id=college-career><strong>College Career</strong></h2><p>In 1997, Tomlinson won an athletic scholarship at Texas Christian University in Fort Worth. During the 1998 season, he led the TCU Horned Frogs to its first bowl win in 41 years, defeating the USC Trojans at the Sun Bowl. The next season, he set an NCAA FBS record for most rushing yards in a single game, with 406. Tomlinson closed out the season with an NCAA-leading 1,850 yards rushing.</p><p>For his senior season, Tomlinson led the NCAA once again with 2,158 yards and 22 touchdowns; he was consequently recognized as a unanimous first-team All-American.

He also won the Offensive Player of the Year Award from the Associated Press, and received ESPY Awards for Male Athlete of the Year, Best Record-Breaking Performance, and Best NFL Athlete. The next season, Tomlinson continued his success by becoming the fourth fastest NFL player to reach 10,000 rushing yards.
