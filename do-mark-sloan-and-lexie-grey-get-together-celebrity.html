It pretty much became a running tradition for Mark and Lexie to be an item at one point in a season, only to break up and run into the arms of another person in the interim.</p><p>Mark and Lexie finally (and very briefly)<strong> get back together</strong>, and it’s as if you never have to watch any more episodes after this one. 2 Let The Bad Times Roll (8.22) Two episodes before her tragic death (don’t watch that one!), Lexie came to the realization that she had to confess her true feelings to Mark.</p><p>While Mark Loan and Lexie ended up together on Grey’s Anatomy, there are many other people Mark could have been with instead. It’s been eight years since the tragic plane crash, and Grey’s Anatomy fans still mourn the loss of Mark and Lexie.</p><p>Mark Sloan was born in 1968 while Lexie Grey arrived in the world in 1984. The difference in ages between the two came up quite a lot on the show, which was one of the reasons why Mark didn’t consider Lexie to be one of notice earlier on.</p><p>From Rose to Amelia Shepherd, here are 10 people Mark Sloan should have ended up with instead of Lexie. In an alternative timeline, Mark and Derek would have made a great couple. Knowing each other since they were 10, fans believed Mark and Derek were the ultimate bromance.</p><p>After Mark and Lexie broke up, she began a short relationship with Alex when she moved back into Meredith’s house. They hooked up that day since Alex was missing Izzie as well. The relationship did not last long, however, as Lexie soon got back together with Mark.</p><h2>What season did Mark and Lexie get together?</h2><p>Mark and Lexie were a couple that just made sense. You didn’t need much of an explanation or justification when it came to these two. In fact, when they were first paired together in Season 5, they worked so well that you’d wonder why Seasons 3 and 4 had been devoid of this pairing.</p><p><strong>Lexie passed away few minutes after the plane went down – and crushed her underneath – while Mark passed away weeks later in a hospital </strong>. This was something by design, engineered by showrunner Shonda Rhimes. According to Rhimes, both of them passing away meant they were together in the afterlife.</p><p>The difference in ages between the two came up quite a lot on the show, which was one of the reasons why Mark didn’t consider Lexie to be one of notice earlier on. But it wouldn’t be long before Mark did turn his attention toward Little Grey and we all know how the journey went.</p><p>The main couple remained Meredith and Derek for all of<strong> 11</strong> seasons before McDreamy passed away, but there were a lot of other characters that people came to adore. Mark and Lexie were a couple that just made sense.</p><p>They had had a bus crash, a shooter and then a plane crash where<strong> Mark and Lexie passed away.</strong> However, this storyline had big consequences in Season 9, making the crash a justified angle.</p><p>In-universe, Lexie couldn’t keep up with Mark putting up with his daughter’s demands and misbehaving self; this led to Lexie leaving Mark<strong> because she could see he would always choose his daughter over her, despite the daughter being completely obnoxious.</strong></p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>The actors playing Mark and Lexie have only a<strong> nine-year</strong> age difference between them; however, the characters have a very marginal sixteen-year age gap. Mark Sloan was born in 1968 while Lexie Grey arrived in the world in 1984.</p><h2>Who played Lexie Grey in Grey’s anatomy?</h2><p>Grey’s Anatomy fans were absolutely thrilled last night when they were treated to not one but two guest appearances on the show. First, fan favorite<strong> Chyler Leigh</strong> came back to reprise her role as Lexie Grey, which was enough to make people lose their minds.</p><p>Meredith asked the two of them. “On your beach,<strong> it looks like we are, </strong>” Mark said. At first, to the untrained Grey’s viewer, that might seem like a clear answer. But if the beach is somewhere that exists between the real world and the afterlife, Mark’s answer seems a little more weird. Like, are they together only on the beach that’s in Meredith’s …</p><p>Emma Baty Emma Baty is<strong> the Associate Entertainment Editor</strong> at Cosmopolitan who focuses on movies and TV.

It became evident that Lexie was jealous of the new budding romance.</p><p>18 Worst: Mark Was Only Interested<strong> Because She Was “Forbidden Fruit” (S5 Ep9)</strong> Mark and Lexie’s relationship wasn’t exactly a fairytale romance as the plastic surgeon initially had no interest in her. It was only until Derek warned him to stay away from her did his attraction towards Lexie begin to grow.</p><p>It also took its toll on Lexie who found herself caught in the middle of their arguments. As a result,<strong> Lexie began to stress eat.</strong></p><p>However, the pressure of keeping it hidden began to get to Lexie. Lexie gave Mark an ultimatum: either he told Derek about<strong> them or they couldn’t be together anymore.</strong></p><p>It was clear to all that Lexie was uncomfortable with the situation. However, she, nevertheless, stayed quiet<strong> because she didn’t want to upset Mark.</strong> As everyone knows, this isn’t exactly how a healthy relationship should unfold.</p><p>Arguably the worst death on the show, Slexie fans’ hearts were<strong> torn in two as they saw Lexie trapped under the plane.</strong> The other doctors tried to get it off her, but it quickly became apparent that Lexie would not survive her injuries. When Cristina went to find Meredith, Mark stayed with Lexie.</p><p>Many fans loved this mini-arc for Lexie as they<strong> were able to see the maturity between the couple grow.</strong> Lexie took her time with her decision and didn’t rush into it. In return, Mark didn’t put any pressure on her and wanted her to decide when the time was right.</p><h2>What did Mark and Lexie prove in Grey’s anatomy?</h2><p>RELATED: Grey’s Anatomy: 5 Moments Mark & Lexie Proved They<strong> Were Couple Goals (& 5 That Proved They Weren’t)</strong> Instead of Bailey standing up for him during the nurses’ strike, Rose and Mark could have shared an honest conversation about his bachelor lifestyle. A relationship between them could have also helped him get over Addison quicker.</p><p>Plus, Callie<strong> helped Mark to mature into a family man and achieve his lifelong dreams.</strong> Fans wouldn’t have minded this ending.</p><p>While Teddy left shortly after Henry’s death,<strong> their relationship could have been reformed out of grief and loneliness.</strong> Mark and Teddy then could have raised a family together.</p><p>They could also be very charming and witty in the company of others. With Amelia permanently moving to<strong> Seattle</strong> in season 10, their one-night-stand could have become something more.</p><p>It’s<strong> no</strong> secret that Mark has had<strong> some romances with</strong> Derek’s sisters. The first time this was revealed was when Nancy visited Seattle after the neurosurgeon didn’t turn up to a couple of family events. As Derek was explaining why he and Addison split, Nancy encouraged him to forgive her, admitting to sleeping with Mark herself.</p><p>In season 6, Mark decided to pursue a relationship with Teddy after the plastic surgeon started to<strong> consider settling down.</strong> They seemed to have a natural chemistry and looked good together – until Mark messed it up by sleeping with Reed.</p><p>She was really good with Sofia and she did<strong> genuinely</strong> love Mark. Although it didn’t work out the first time around, it might have a few years down the line once Mark felt ready to move on with his life.</p><p><h3 class=jp-relatedposts-headline>Related</h3></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivmaC2b6%2FEpZybqpmpxm%2ByzGibqGWdlr%2BsedKlppqmXZa7pXnLnq%2BinV2cv6bFjKCcrWWkpLSmwMeeqWZpYG6AdX6O</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./jen-taylor-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Jen Taylor Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth">&larr;
