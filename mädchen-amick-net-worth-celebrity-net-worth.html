She attended Robert McQueen High School, but she dropped out in 1987 to pursue an acting and modeling career in Los Angeles at age 16.</p><h2 id=career><strong>Career</strong></h2><p>Mädchen made her television debut in a 1988 episode of the soap opera "Days of Our Lives," then she guest-starred on "Star Trek: The Next Generation" (1989) and appeared in the TV movies "Baywatch: Panic at Malibu Pier" (1989) and "I'm Dangerous Tonight" (1990) and the film "The Boyfriend School" (1990). Her big break came when director <a href=# title="David Lynch Net Worth">David Lynch</a> cast her as waitress Shelly Johnson on the ABC series "Twin Peaks." Amick appeared in all 30 episodes of the series, and she reprised her role in the 1992 prequel film "Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me" and the 2017 Showtime revival (sometimes called "Twin Peaks: The Return"). Mädchen appeared in the 1991 film "The Borrower" and played Tanya Robertson in the 1992 <a href=# title="Stephen King Net Worth">Stephen King</a> movie "Sleepwalkers," then she co-starred with <a href=# title="James Spader Net Worth">James Spader</a> in 1993's "Dream Lover" and with <a href=# title="Dana Carvey Net Worth">Dana Carvey</a>, <a href=# title="Jon Lovitz Net Worth">Jon Lovitz</a>, and <a href=# title="Nicolas Cage Net Worth">Nicolas Cage</a> in 1994's "Trapped in Paradise."

Amick showed off her vocal talents in the episode "Chapter Thirty-One: A Night to Remember," in which Alice was cast as Margaret White in Riverdale High's ill-fated production of "Carrie the Musical," and she sang again in the "Hedwig and the Angry Inch"-inspired episode "Chapter Seventy-Four: Wicked Little Town."</p><h2 id=personal-life><strong>Personal Life</strong></h2><p>Mädchen married David Alexis on December 16, 1995.
