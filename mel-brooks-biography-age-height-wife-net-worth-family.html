The Broadway hit musical then lead to the musical movie The Producers (2005).</p><p>He also worked in the creation of The 2000 Year Old Man (1975) and Get Smart (1965) before embarking on a highly successful film career in writing, acting, producing and directing.</p><p>Is close friends with Italian television star <a href=#>Ezio Greggio</a>, whose movies he inspired.

It was a surprisingly successful hip-hop/dance hit in 1981. He followed it up with "Hitler Rap" for To Be or Not to Be (1983). The song was not as successful. But the lyric "Don't be stupid, be a smarty/Come and join the Nazi Party" was originally used in the original movie version of The Producers (1967), then later reused in Brooks' Broadway version of "The Producers".</p><p>Was considered for the role of Dr. Sam Loomis in the horror film Halloween (1978), which went to <a href=#>Donald Pleasence</a>.</p><p>Though Blazing Saddles (1974) and Young Frankenstein (1974) are often cited as his best and most popular films as a director, his biggest video sales are Spaceballs (1987) and Robin Hood: Men In Tights (1993).</p><p>His film The Producers (1967) was the inspiration for the title of the album "Achtung Baby" (1991) by the rock band U2.</p><p>In 1966, he was about to co-star in a movie called "Easy Come, Easy Go" with <a href=#>Jan Berry</a> and <a href=#>Dean Torrence</a> in the leading roles.

It was never filmed.</p><p>Brooks introduced himself to Anne Bancroft in 1961 while she was making her first appearance on Perry Como's Kraft Music Hall (1948) (she would later return to appear on that show on various occasions over several years). Brooks bribed a woman who worked on the show to tell him at which restaurant Bancroft was going to dine so he could "accidentally" bump into her again and strike up a conversation. It worked. The two fell in love and eventually married at New York City's municipal Marriage Bureau in Lower Manhattan, where a passerby served as witness.</p><p>He has two roles in common with both Peter Cushing and Dennis Price: (1) Cushing played Victor Frankenstein in The Curse of Frankenstein (1957).

"World Film Directors, Volume Two, 1945-1985." Pages 162-167. New York: The H.W. Wilson Company, 1988.</p><p>The 1944 edition of the Eastern District High School (Brooklyn, N.Y.) yearbook featured the future Mel Brooks (born Melvin Kaminsky) stating that his goal was to become President of the United States; forty-three years later, in 1987, his ambition was to be fulfilled, if only in fiction and in part -- in the movie Spaceballs (1987), he portrayed Spaceball leader "President Skroob" (an anagram of "Brooks").</p><p>In an NPR interview, he mentioned that he attended Virginia Military Institute and thus, in reference to the 1938 film's setting, was a "Brother Rat".</p><p>His running "walk this way" gag is also the inspiration for the song "Walk This Way" by Aerosmith. The gag was copied from William Powell's ad-lib in After the Thin Man (1936).</p><p>Mel Brooks was born Melvin Kaminsky on June 28, 1926 in Brooklyn, New York. He served in WWII, and afterwards got a job playing the drums at nightclubs in the Catskills. Brooks eventually started a comedy act and also worked in radio and as Master Entertainer at Grossinger's Resort before going to television.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmsmZeaxKq3yGeaqKVforKtecGrpqijow%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./pirates-of-the-caribbean-supporters-upset-after-johnny-depp-rules-out-return.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Pirates of the Caribbean supporters upset after Johnny Depp rules out return">&larr;
