The&nbsp;<a href=#>Queen of Country</a>&nbsp;has been like an open book when it comes to discussing her childhood. The “Jolene” artist, who was born on Jan. 19, 1946, revealed that she had 11 siblings and grew up in a one-room cabin&nbsp;with no electricity or running water. However, even though <a href=#>they didn’t have money</a>, Parton said they “were rich in things that money don’t buy.”</p><p id=par-2_26>Read on to find out what Parton’s brothers and sisters are up to today and what the <a href=#>country music star</a>‘s relationship is like with them.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Dolly-Parton-is-interviewed-in-Seacrest-Studio-at-Monroe-Carell-Jr.-Vanderbilt-Childrens-Hospital.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-willadeene-parton>Willadeene Parton</h2><p id=par-3_63>Parton has stated that her family is very important to her and she has always remained close with her siblings. The eldest child born to her parents Avie Lee and Robert Lee was Willadeene, who arrived on March 24, 1940. Because she was the oldest, Willadeene helped her mother a lot when it came to taking care of her brothers and sisters.</p><p id=par-4_49>As for a career, Wiladeene tried her hand at gospel singing initially but decided she wanted to write books instead. She authored the Parton family memoir titled Smoky Mountain Memories: Stories from the Hearts of the Parton Family, as well as a cookbook titled&nbsp;All-Day Singing &&nbsp;Dinner on the Ground.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-stella-mae-parton>Stella Mae Parton</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Dolly-Parton-and-Stella-Parton-attend-the-premiere-of-Dolly-Partons-Coat-Of-Many-Colors.jpg><p id=par-5_23>Stella was born on May 4, 1949.

That’s because their famous sister once revealed that she had her brother, who’s a carpenter, do work inside her family’s old cabin to restore it to the way it was when they were kids.</p><p id=par-25_64>“What we tried to do was make it look like it did when we lived there, but we wanted it to be functional. So I spent a couple million dollars making it look like I spent $50 on it,” Parton explained during an appearance on&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Nate Berkus Show</a>. “Even like in the bathroom, I made the bathroom so it looked like an outdoor toilet.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS2r7%2FInZxmnJ%2Bhubp5z5qpraeeYr%2BmuMCtoKimo522sXnSopmloZ6cwG%2B006ajaA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./that-taxidermist-was-made-to-look-creepy-on-purpose.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="That Taxidermist Was Made to Look 'Creepy' On Purpose">&larr;
