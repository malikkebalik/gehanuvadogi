The incident grabbed headlines, prompting a thorough investigation by law enforcement.</p><p>In a press conference held on a somber Monday, October 2, New York’s Governor, Kathy Hochul, shared the troubling news with the public. According to her, Ross was the person behind Charlotte Sena’s abduction.</p><p>During the investigation, a crucial breakthrough occurred. It was revealed that the suspect had left a chilling ransom note in the mailbox of Charlotte’s parents. This piece of evidence became the key that eventually led the authorities to Craig Ross Jr. His fingerprints on the note provided the vital link, connecting him to the crime and leading to his apprehension.</p><p>Governor Kathy Hochul confirmed this information in a late-night press conference with State Police. According to Hochul, Ross had left the ransom note in the Sena family’s mailbox around 4:20 a.m. on Monday, indicating the calculated nature of the crime.</p><p>The investigation eventually led authorities to a trailer on a property owned by Ross’s relatives along Barrett Road in Milton, New York. The property where Charlotte was found turned out to belong to Ross’s mother, adding a layer of complexity to the case.</p><p>During the press conference, Governor Hochul revealed that the suspect had been living in close proximity to the crime scene, behind a trailer on the property.</p><p></p><h2><strong>Craig Nelson Ross Jr Was Arrested Several Times</strong></h2><p>Craig Ross, a man with a dark criminal history, has been arrested in connection with the disappearance of little Charlotte Sena. Ross, whose past includes convictions for second-degree aggravated harassment in 2016 and criminal obstruction of breathing in 2017, was apprehended by authorities on October 2, 2023.</p><p>The story unfolds around Moreau Lake State Park, where Charlotte vanished without a trace. Witnesses placed Ross in the vicinity, prompting a massive search operation.</p><p>In a press release that sent shockwaves through the community, law enforcement detailed the frantic search that led them to multiple residences associated with Ross.</p><p>At 6:32 p.m. on October 2, 2023, the State Police made a breakthrough—they found Charlotte Sena safe and in good health. The little girl was rescued from the clutches of danger, and the suspect was promptly taken into custody.</p><p>Governor Hochul thanked the police and the community for their help in finding Charlotte. She said,</p><p>“I promised her parents we’ll find their daughter. She’s all of our daughters,” Hochul said. “Their family needs love. They need prayers. And if you know anything, if you’ve seen anything, you hear anything, please contact 911 to tell us what you know and what you may contribute to the search for this little girl.”</p><h2><strong>Did Craig Ross Jr. know about Cena’s family?</strong></h2><p>Craig Nelson Ross Jr, the suspect in Charlotte Sena Abduction, lived two miles from Sena’s house. Nobody knows yet if this person knew Sena or was keeping an eye on her.</p><p>According to MissingKids.org, The police canceled an Amber Alert right before they found Sena, which is strange and confusing.</p><p>Investigators are currently exploring theories, focusing on the possibility that she might have been taken forcibly into a vehicle or dragged into the woods against her will.</p><p>Despite these details, authorities have not yet disclosed the motive behind the incident. The investigation is ongoing, and more information may emerge as the case unfolds.</p><p><img fetchpriority=high decoding=async title="Craig Nelson Ross Jr Mugshot" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Craig-Nelson-Ross-Jr-Mugshot.webp alt="Craig Nelson Ross Jr Mugshot" width=400 height=536 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2><strong>Craig Ross Jr’s Mugshot Shared on Facebook</strong></h2><p>The suspect in the Charlotte Sena kidnapping, Craig Nelson Ross Jr., was taken into custody on October 3, 2023.</p><p>Some people on Facebook shared an old mugshot of his, which showed him to be a 6 feet 4 inches tall guy and weighing 250 pounds.</p><p>What makes it even more interesting is that when you dig into his Facebook page, you find something unusual, which is reportedly connected to his family, including his mother. It only has 26 friends and no photos.</p><p><img decoding=async title="Craig Ross Jr's Son Joshua Ross Speaks Out" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Craig-Ross-Jrs-Son-Joshua-Ross-Speaks-Out.webp alt="Craig Ross Jr's Son Joshua Ross Speaks Out" width=450 height=273 sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2><strong>Craig Ross Jr’s Son Joshua Ross Speaks Out</strong></h2><p>Craig Nelson Ross Jr., the man arrested for first-degree kidnapping Charlotte Sena, is facing damning accusations from the person he might have least expected.</p><p>After his arrest <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">TMZ</a> cameras caught up with Joshua Ross, the adult son of the suspect, at the very residence where police arrested his father.</p><p>In an explosive on-camera interview, Joshua didn’t mince words as he vehemently disavowed his father, making it abundantly clear that there is no love lost between them.</p><p>Standing in front of his father’s home, Joshua expressed his complete disdain for Craig Ross Jr. and his alleged heinous actions. “We want nothing to do with him,” Joshua declared, his voice filled with anger and disappointment. “I couldn’t give a f*** if the dude dropped dead tomorrow. I couldn’t care less.”</p><p>The interview took a shocking turn when Joshua didn’t hold back, describing his father in the harshest terms imaginable. “He’s disgusting, he’s gross,” Joshua spat, his words laced with venom. “He should die. I couldn’t care less. I couldn’t give a rat’s a** what happens.”</p><p>Clearly, the strained relationship between Ross Jr. and his children has reached a breaking point, with Joshua and his sister distancing themselves from their father with every ounce of their being.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmsr5WauG%2BvzqZmsKCfYra0ecKrmKKfXaOyrb%2FOp2Srp6Ooequ%2BjJyfmqqcpMG1sYysnKeZXZavpcHCraCopl2owrS8xJyraA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./who-won-week-2-s-power-of-veto-on-big-brother-25.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who won week 2s Power of Veto on Big Brother 25?">&larr;
