In 2011 he exhibited Show Me the Money series at Curators Voice Art Gallery in MIAMI, in which he crushed dollar bills and photographed it against a solid black background, creating images which deceive the viewer’s perception and question the traditional canons of economic power. The Wynwood atmosphere in the heart of the Miami art district, with its graffiti, vibrant art street and galleries, invited him to turn to his third expressive way, painting. In 2012 Robierb debut in New York City art scene at Emmanuel Freming Gallery with his Bullet-Fly Effect series, a group of photographs in which he performed compositions that fused the body of a butterfly, symbol of beauty, with war materials like bullets or machine guns with a result that dramatically evokes images of transformation, beauty, war and death, while establishes a reference to the ‘butterfly effect’ in the Chaos Theory, where the flapping of a butterfly's wings in New York can create a tsunami in Japan. In 2013 at Taglialatella Gallery in New York City, Robierb made his Bullets & Butterflies show, with the same subject as Bullet Fly Effect series but now, with a series of paintings instead of photographs. In 2015 at 212 Gallery in Aspen, the artist showed his HeArt series of paintings that juxtaposes the symbolic heart with everyday symbols and phrases. In 2015 Robierb was commissioned by the city of Fort Lauderdale to paint Metamorph-Us, a large mural in the downtown area, on the outer walls of The Shade-Post, a multipurpose space for art and design. Robierb was named as one of the featured emerging artists on Art Southampton 2015.</p><p>Robierb has participated in group exhibitions such as Corpo Revelado, Blue Life Cultural Space, São Paulo, Brazil (2006), Art Curial for Fight Aids Monaco Foundation, Monaco (2007), Photophantasma, Avant Gallery, Miami (2009), Arteaméricas Art Fair, Canal Gallery, Miami (2012), The Suit, Kasia Kay Art Projects, Chicago (2014), Beautiful Objects , Curator's Voice Art project, Miami (2014), Hot Spot, Curator's Voice Art Projects, Miami (2015), among others.</p><p>Robierb work caught the attention of Art et Partage Association, which in 2005 commissioned him his first solo exhibition, Brezil Autrement (Otherwise Brazil) in Aix-en-Provence, France. Subsequently, São Paulo, Zurich, Monaco, Paris and Milan galleries exhibited his photographs. In 2008 Robierb settled in Miami, U.S., attracted by the Latin flair of this city. He opened a studio in Wynwood and began to participate in the artistic atmosphere of Miami, with a constant presence in Art Basel week. He began experimenting with images printed on metallic paper fused with plexiglass with which he achieved highly expressive large formats.</p><p>Rubem Robierb (born 1 December 1976) is a Brazilian visual artist, whose current medium and style is linked to the Pop-Art movement by using the two-dimensional image and its repetition as a resource.
