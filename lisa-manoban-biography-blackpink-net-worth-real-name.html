Till now, that video has amassed more than 11 million views.</p><p>The video showcased the dancing skill of Lisa without ever revealing her identity. The funny thing was, unlike their other videos, it was first for YG to keep the name secret. Not even her nationality or age was revealed.</p><p>After many years of training and waiting, the girl on the video was revealed to be our very own Lisa. With three other members, <strong>Jennie, Jisoo, </strong>and <strong>Rose, Lisa </strong>debuted as Blackpink on August 8, 2016.&nbsp;</p><h2>Blackpink Is The Revolution</h2><p>Since its debut, Blackpink has amassed massive success in both the domestic and international Music Industry.</p><p>They have achieved considerable feats in Music by being the first girl group in the world to have 27 million subscribers on Youtube, beating Fifth Harmony and Little Mix.</p><p>Also, their ‘DDU-Du-DDU-Du‘ became the first Music video by a girl group to cross 800 million views on Youtube.</p><p>Apart from that, Blackpink has won many awards in their home, including the ‘New Artist of the Year’ and ‘Bongsang Award‘ at Seoul Music Awards in 2017 and 2018, respectively.</p><p>Similarly, they have also won the ‘Gaon Chart Music Awards&nbsp;and ‘Best Music Video ‘ at the ‘Mnet Asian Music Awards‘ in 2016.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/tvshowstars.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/lisa-0004-1.jpg><p>Not only that, Blackpink has become the first Korean Girl Group to have a successful World Tour, including Hongkong, Singapore, Japan, Korea, France, Germany, Belgium, Netherlands, USA, Australia, Brazil, and so on.</p><p>Following their global influence and marking their World Tour, Blackpink even appeared in numerous American TV shows and Radios, including Late Night with James Corden, Good morning America, etc.</p><p>Blackpink also made history by becoming the first girl group from Korea to perform at Coachella (2019), the largest music festival in the World.

Similarly, Lisa also lives her life away from the prying eyes of media and fans.</p><p>Moreover, aside from her friends and family members, Lisa rarely shares anything more in her social accounts.</p><p>Also, Thai idol is not dating anyone at the moment. But at times, rumors are coming along that Lisa is dating Jungbook of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">BTS</a>.</p><p>No assurance is available about it, but if something pops up, we will let readers know about it.
