A variety of strange hair pieces were popular back then — ones that had sequins on them, ones that were unnecessarily wide, and even ones with bandanas attached. Some of them were bad, to say the least. Yet these were <a href=# class=T3D>the '90s headbands you insisted on wearing</a> every. single. day.</p><p>Don't get me wrong, I love headbands almost as much as Blair Waldorf (<a href=# class=T3D>if that's even possible</a>). They're a chic, classic accessory that not only pushes the hair out of your face but also makes a dramatic style statement. But looking back at the versions that we all wore, and loved, in the '90s, the headband clearly had a bit of an identity crisis for awhile.</p><p>Without further ado, here are the 13 headbands you insisted on wearing in the '90s, no matter what your parents said about them. From your beloved sequined version to the plastic floral one you still have stored somewhere in your childhood bedroom, these headbands are so bad they're good. Some of them might even still be wearable today (maybe). Prepare to revisit all your hair memories from youth, now!</p><h3>1. The Hair Comb Headband</h3><figure class="Qf5 E1M"></figure><p><b><a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Plastic Teeth Comb Headband</a>, $2, <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Amazon</a></b></p><p>Remember rocking one of these and then getting home from school and finding it at the back of your head? You know you do.</p><h3>2. The Thin Headband</h3><figure class="Qf5 E1M"></figure><p><b>7 Pc Set Vintage Headbands/90s, $9, Etsy</b></p><p>Ahh, an assortment of thin headbands. One for every day of the week! Or one for every time you snap one in half because that's how delicate they were. Sigh.</p><h3>3. The Flower Crown Headband</h3><p><b><a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Flower Crown Headband</a>, $8, <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Amazon</a></b></p><p>If you thought the flower crown was a 2010s invention for music festivals, then you thought wrong! The style was so big in the '90s, even Drew Barrymore rocked it.</p><h3>4. The Thick Headband</h3><figure class="Qf5 E1M"><p>AFP/AFP/Getty Images</p></figure><p><b><a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Black Thick Headband</a>, $7, <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Amazon</a></b></p><p>A thick headband? Truly a presidential choice!</p><h3>5. The Bandana Headband</h3><p><b><a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Levi's Bandana Set</a>, $8, <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Amazon</a></b></p><p>For all those times you wanted to wear a headband and a bandana at the same time!</p><h3>6. The Sweatband</h3><p><b><a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Red White and Blue Sweatband</a>, $6, <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Amazon</a></b></p><p>This ones for the guys that used to ironically wear sweatbands, even when they weren't working out. Hopefully this is one thing <a href=# class=T3D>the athleisure trend</a> doesn't bring back.</p><h3>7. The Wire Bow Headband</h3><figure class="Qf5 E1M"></figure><p><b><a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Wire Bow Headband</a>, $8, <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Amazon</a></b></p><p>Anyone else have a weird obsession with bows in middle school? Or was that just me?</p><h3>8. The Classic One-Color Headband</h3><figure class="Qf5 E1M"></figure><p><b><a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Set of 12 Wide Satin Headband</a>, $18, <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Amazon</a></b></p><p>You really can't go wrong with a solid colored headband that's not only great at getting your hair out of your face, but also gives you all the '90s memz.</p><h3>9. The Sequined Headband</h3><figure class="Qf5 E1M"></figure><p><b>90s Head Bands Hair Bows Set, $12, Etsy</b></p><p>Let's not forget that <a href=# class=T3D>we</a> <a href=# class=T3D>all loved sequins</a> back in the '90s. And what better place to wear them than on your headband? Eye-catching, for sure.</p><h3>10. The Printed Headband</h3><figure class="Qf5 E1M"></figure><p><b><a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Black and White Checkered Headband</a>, $11, <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Amazon</a></b></p><p>Whether you love tie-dye, floral print, or paisley, you can rock it all on a headband with a cool print. Not going to lie, this is one look I'd still wear today.</p><h3>11. The Embellished Headband</h3><figure class="Qf5 E1M"></figure><p><b>Vintage Diamond Diamond Style Headband, $15, Etsy</b></p><p>It's a bird, it's a plane, it's a sparkling, embellished headband! In complete honesty, I would also totally still wear this today.</p><p>Like I said, the '90s were a rough time for headbands. But at least we can laugh about it now. Or cry. Whichever one suits your fancy!</p><p>Want more fashion and beauty tips?
