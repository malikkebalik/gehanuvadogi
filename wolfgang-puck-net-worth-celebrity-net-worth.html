An internationally famous chef, restaurateur, businessman, author, and actor, Puck oversees a vast cooking empire that includes books, more than 20 restaurants, celebrity catering services (including the Academy Awards), and various packaged foods and cooking-related products. Wolfgang has turned from a curious boy learning how to cook from his part-time pastry chef mother into a true celebrity chef to rival all others.</p><p>Wolfgang Puck did that thing about which many chefs dream. &nbsp;He created a culinary empire. The Austrian-born chef began cooking when he was a child, helping his mother out in the kitchen. &nbsp;As a young adult, he moved to France to train as an apprentice under Raymond Thuilier at L'Oustau de BaumaniÃ¨re in Les Baux-de-Provence. &nbsp;He then moved on to the Hotel de Paris in Monaco, and Maxim's Paris. &nbsp;He moved again in the early 70's, settling in the US. He began his US culinary career at La Tour in Indianapolis, Indiana, and then moved on to Ma Maison in Los Angeles. &nbsp;At Ma Maison, he began to build a widespread reputation for excellence, and the 1981 publication of his cookbook, "Modern French Cooking for the American Kitchen" catapulted him to national fame. &nbsp;A year later, he opened his first Spago on the Sunset Strip.&nbsp; From there, he went on to open a second location, and then launched the Wolfgang Puck Companies. &nbsp;The various entities under this umbrella include the Wolfgang Puck Fine Dining Group, Wolfgang Puck Worldwide, Inc. and Wolfgang Puck Catering. He controls a vast empire of successful restaurants, catering companies, cookbooks, kitchen implements, and packaged foods. &nbsp;He has won a dizzying array of culinary honors, and is the official caterer for the Oscars. &nbsp;He has appeared on talk shows, television series, and on various reality competition shows.&nbsp; He also had his own show on The Food Network. As of today, his fine dining restaurants, catering locations, and numerous licensed products are all run by Wolfgang Puck Companies.</p><h2 id=early-life><strong>Early Life</strong></h2><p>Wolfgang Puck was born Wolfgang Johannes Topfschnig on July 8, 1949, in Sankt Veit an der Glan, Austria.
