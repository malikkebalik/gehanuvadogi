He first gained fame in the early 2000s as a rapper when he signed with No Limit Records. No Limit was founded by Lil Romeo's father, <a href=#>Master P</a>.</p><h2 id=early-life><strong>Early Life</strong></h2><p>Percy Romeo Miller, better known by his stage name Romeo (formerly Lil Romeo), was born in New Orleans, Louisiana, on August 19, 1989. Music and performing run in his family; his parents Master P and Sonya C were both rappers, he is the nephew of rappers <a href=#>C-Murder</a> and Silkk the Shocker, the cousin of singer/rapper Mo B. Dick, and the brother of singer/actress Cymphonique Miller.</p><h2 id=music-career><strong>Music Career</strong></h2><p>Romeo's career began early, at the age of five, when he was signed to Soulja Music Entertainment, a subsidiary label of No Limit Records, after he wrote a rap for his father Master P. Seven years later, he released his debut album "Lil' Romeo"(2001) with No Limit, which included the number one single "My Baby." The album performed well, peaking at number 6 on the Billboard 200, selling more than 200,000 copies in its first week.

His third studio album "Romeoland" was released in 2004 with The New No Limit and Koch, and once again did not perform as well on the charts, peaking at number 70 on the Billboard 200.
