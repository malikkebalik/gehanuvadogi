In fact, Emeraude was only ten when she appeared on the television for the very first time.</p><p>It was the 1999’s children’s program called El Mundo de Los Ninos. But it was her participation in the second season of the Univision beauty pageant series, Nuestra Belleza Latina, that elevated her fame to the next level.</p><p>Likewise, in the intense series, Toubia ranked as runner-up and was featured in various advertisements such as Maybelline, J.C. Penny, Sony, AT & T, and Garnier.

Also, in 2013, the actress co-hosted the mun2 red carpet special for the Billboard Latin Music Awards.&nbsp;</p><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajsIts3V2EA</p><p>However, it was only in 2013 that the Canadian-born actress made her acting debut on the small screen.
