Today there are at least a dozen known individuals, <a href=#>including the Winklevoss twins</a>, who are officially billionaires thanks exclusively to their crypto holdings. The latest entrant to the crypto billionaire club is Ethereum co-creator <a href=#>Vitalik Buterin</a>.</p><p>Vitalik Buterin owns around 333,000 Ethereum coins. As of this writing, a single Ether coin will cost you around $4,100. So Vitalik's stash of 333,000 are officially worth…</p><h2><strong>$1.4 billion</strong></h2><p>Yet that's not the number you see right now on Vitalik's public wallet.</p><p>Here's a screenshot of the public wallet:</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/16b.png alt width=900 height=1088 sizes="(max-width: 1242px) 100vw, 1242px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><h2><strong>$16.3 billion…</strong></h2><p>Where's that other $15 billion coming from? This is a truly insane story that only makes sense in the completely bonkers crypto world.</p><p>According to a story first reported by the website <a href=#>decrypt.co</a>, roughly $14 billion if Vitalik's wealth came in the form of A GIFT. The gift was given to him by the creators of a dogecoin knockoff called Shiba Inu, aka "SHIB."</p><p>Buterin has nothing to do with SHIB and he had no idea about the gift.</p><p>Last month the creators of SHIB released a white paper, which they called a "woofpaper". In the woofpaper they revealed that they sent 50% of all SHIB, roughly 505 billion coins, to Vitalik's wallet without his knowledge.</p><p><span style=color:red><strong>***UPDATE*** As of 8pm EST on Monday, Vitalik's net worth is actually $21 billion!!! His SHIB holdings are worth $18 billion. ***</strong></span></p><h2><strong>Why would they do this?</strong></h2><p>According to my friend who very deep in the crypto world:</p><p>"<strong>Probably as a publicity stunt the worked phenomenally well. Thinly veiled as them burning half the coins in circulation, but they probably still own a shit ton of SHIB.</strong>"</p><p>Sort of like, imagine if I gifted half of CelebrityNetWorth to <a href=# title="Elon Musk Net Worth">Elon Musk</a> and then within a few weeks CNW was one of the largest websites in the world thanks to the publicity. Kind of brilliant actually… hmmm….</p><p>At the time they made the transfer, 505 billion SHIB were worth around $8.6 million thanks to it's price of $0.000000017.</p><p>Here's what's happened to SHIB's price in the last few weeks:</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/shib.jpg alt width=631 height=592 sizes="(max-width: 631px) 100vw, 631px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>The value of SHIB has increased more than 700% in the last week alone. It increased nearly 4,000% the week of 4/20. The price roughly doubled in the time I began writing this article on Sunday afternoon, May 9 and Monday morning, May 10.</p><p>When you include Vitalik's holdings, SHIB is the 12th-largest cryptocurrency in the world.</p><p>Now of course it should be noted that Vitalik could destroy SHIB in an instant if he decided to offload the entire currency at once. Also, there's likely a very artificially low supply of purchasable SHIB which is driving up the price significantly.</p><p>As I type this article right now, Vitalik's unwittingly gifted collection of 505 billion SHIB are worth…</p><h2><strong>$14 billion</strong></h2><p>It appears as though a bunch of other stunt coins have begun gifting Vitalik huge shares of coins as well. As of this writing, I count dozens of random coins in Vitalik's wallet. His third-largest holding (after Ether and SHIB) is a coin called Akita Inu. As of this writing, Vitalik owns $700m worth of AKITA. He also owns $265 million worth of Dogelon and $21 million of HuskyToken.</p><p>When you combine all of these holdings, Vitalik Buterin's net worth is…</p><h2><strong>$16.3 billion</strong></h2><p>At $16.3 billion net worth, according to our list of <a href=#>the richest people in the world</a>, Vitalik Buterin currently ranks at…</p><h2><span style=color:red><strong>#105</strong></span></h2><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-319401 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Vitalik-Buterin.jpg alt width=900 height=600 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-319401 class=wp-caption-text>(Photo by John Phillips/Getty Images for TechCrunch)</p><h2><strong>Who Is Vitalik Buterin?</strong></h2><p>Vitalik Buterin was born in Russia in 1994. His family moved to Canada when he was six.</p><p>Vitalik excelled in mathematics, economics and computer science at a young age and was placed in a high school for gifted students.</p><p>He first became interested in cryptocurrency while he was still in high school. In his senior year of high school, Vitalik and a group of friends co-created Bitcoin Magazine. The magazine is considered the first serious publication dedicated exclusively to cryptocurrency news and information.</p><p>In 2013 Vitalik enrolled at the University of Waterloo where he took advanced computer science and programming classes while pursuing a burgeoning obsession with digital currency. That obsession eventually resulted in a 2013 white paper published by Vitalik in which he described a goal of creating a blockchain application that could be attached to real-world assets such as property, stocks and bonds.</p><p>This kernel of an idea led to the 2014 announcement of Ethereum.</p><p>That same year, Vitalik dropped out of college to fully concentrate on Etheurem after receiving a $100,000 Thiel Fellowship grant. The currency officially launched in July 2015.</p><p>The price stayed fairly flat, under $10, from its launch until mid-2017. Take a loot at what's happened in the middle of 2018 and in the last few months:</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/chart.jpg alt width=843 height=389 sizes="(max-width: 843px) 100vw, 843px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>As of this writing, Ethereum has a market cap of $450 billion. That's second only to Bitcoin's $1.1 trillion. The price of Ethereum has risen 400% since January alone.</p><p>As we mentioned previously, Vitalik Buterin owns 333,521 ETH. At the current price I'm seeing of $3,900, Vitalik's ETH stash is worth <strong>$1.3 billion.</strong></p><h2><strong>What is Ether All About?</strong></h2><p>Ether's distinguishing feature is its focus on digital contracts that potentially have very valuable real-world applications. For example, in a traditional music catalog sale – like when <a href=# title="Bob Dylan Net Worth">Bob Dylan</a> sells his copyrights for $400 million – the artist takes a huge chunk of money to relinquish all future income from the music. With an Ethereum-powered digital contract, an artist might opt to sell their catalog with a clause that allows them to earn a fee every time the catalog is sold again, in perpetuity.</p><p>That's exactly what's happening with NFTs.</p><p>Did you hear about how the artist <a href=#>Beeple sold a piece of digital art for $69 million</a>? Every time that same piece of art is re-sold in the future, the blockchain will send part of the new purchase price back to Beeple.</p><p>True believers in Ethereum see the currency eventually being a crucial element any time someone buys a major asset, physical or not. For example a house, a car, a piece of art or even stocks.</p><p>Or maybe a website 🙂</p><p><span style=color:red><strong>If any crypto billionaires out there want to make an offer on CNW, Twitter DMs are open!</strong></span></p><p>***UPDATE***</p><p>On the afternoon of May 12, Vitalik began dumping huge chunks of the dog coins. In a matter of hours his net worth dropped in half to $10 billion. In a few hours he converted $60 million to Ether and donated the proceeds to various charities. He transferred $1 billion worth of SHIB to India's Covid relief fund.</p><p>More info these sales as they happen in this article:</p><p><a href=#>Vitalik Buterin Is Dumping All His Dog Coins We Speak And Donating The Proceeds</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue8Crq6KbnJrAcK7IpaOip56WtrOxjKecsKtfmsGpsdGerKZlk6R6pL7Emquoql2rtrWty6KiZpqlqbKztc1moKxlnqTEbq2Mm6ClpJmku6K10Z5m</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./tyler-florence-s-banana-pecan-pancakes-are-a-decadent-weekend-treat.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Tyler Florence's Banana Pecan Pancakes Are a Decadent Weekend Treat">&larr;
