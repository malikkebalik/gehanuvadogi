He’s often associated with other entertainers who were either up and coming or popular during that same era, and there is a string of stories attached to him.</p><p id=par-2_46>Music’s Queen of Hip Hop Soul <a href=#>Mary J. Blige</a> rarely comes up when people talk about Tupac’s connections, but the two did know each other. And according to a former Death Row bodyguard, the late rapper indirectly intervened when Blige had issues with her boyfriend, K-Ci.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/tupac-mary-j-blige.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Mary J. Blige used to date Jodeci’s K-Ci</h2><p id=par-3_34>In the early ’90s, Blige began dating R&B singer K-Ci Hailey of Jodeci. It’s become somewhat common knowledge that the pair had a tumultuous relationship for years, something Blige has spoken about openly interviews.</p><p id=par-4_45>During her VH1 <a href=#>Behind the Music</a> episode, she described it as hell. “I brought hell to his life because I was already damaged. He brought hell to my life because he was already damaged. And that’s the result we ended up with: Hell,” she said.</p><p id=par-5_44>Things came to a head after K-Ci gave Blige a ring but later went on a TV show and denied having any intentions of marrying her. A talk show host showed Blige the clip after she said she was engaged, and she felt humiliated.</p><p id=par-6_25>However, when they were together, they’d often have volatile fights while on tour. Allegedly, it was during one of those moments when Tupac was called.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Former bodyguard says Tupac picked up Mary J. Blige</h2><p id=par-7_54>Tupac began working with Death Row Records in 1995. After K-Ci and Jo Jo broke off from Jodeci to become a duo, they recorded “How Do U Want It” and “Toss It Up” with the late rapper at the studios at Death Row. The brothers developed a friendship with him that went beyond business.</p><p id=par-8_42>According to former bodyguard Reggie Wright, Tupac knew them during the time K-Ci was dating Blige. Wright told <a href=#>Cam Capone News</a> when all three R&B singers were on a tour stop in California, Blige and K-Ci must have gotten into a fight.</p><p id=par-9_46>“They got into a fight. Somehow, she called Pac. ‘Cause her and Pac were on the down-low cool. We had to run over to the Peninsula Hotel,” said Wright. He recalled that Blige ran from the side of the hotel and quickly hopped into the car.</p><p id=par-10_23>“She was running down the side street and jumped in the car right quick. And Pac picked her up and took her off.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Blige broke things off with K-Ci</h2><p id=par-11_27>As one of music’s most high-profile couples in the ’90s, Blige and K-Ci were under constant public scrutiny. But Blige said leaving that relationship behind was necessary.</p><p id=par-12_72>“He had to be out,” she once told <a href=#>The Guardian</a>. “That was something that was holding me back. He didn’t want me to have nothing. He didn’t want me to sing when I was already a singer. He held me back from shows when I had to get on planes. When I say mental and physical abuse, everyone knows it was him. He’d use Jodeci interviews to say horrible things about me.”</p><p id=par-13_28>K-Ci has since apologized to Blige in interviews but other than collaborating once (and recording separately) after their split, it’s unclear if the two are on friendly terms.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGTBtrzAnGSoppOaeqStzJ5kraddoq6zxYyjZJukmZyybr7ErJqunV2WsKS70Z2gp59dqbxurs6dsKCtkaexb7TTpqNo</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./wedding-movies-shadowhunters-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Wedding, Movies, Shadowhunters &amp;amp; Net Worth">&larr;
